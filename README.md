# 🧠 CS50's AI Projects – Python Implementations

Welcome to my solutions for [CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/), a course offered by Harvard University. This repository contains a collection of AI-focused projects, each designed to implement foundational concepts in artificial intelligence using Python.

## 📁 Projects Included

- **Search** – Solving mazes using uninformed and informed search algorithms.
- **Tic Tac Toe** – Unbeatable game AI using Minimax.
- **Knights** – Propositional logic puzzles (Knights and Knaves).
- **Minesweeper** – Logical reasoning to identify mines on a board.
- **Crossword** – Constraint satisfaction problem for auto-generating crosswords.
- **Updating Beliefs** – Probabilistic reasoning to track changing environments.
- **Nim** – Reinforcement learning agent that learns to play Nim.
- **Degrees** – Graph search to find connections between actors.
- **Shopping** – Naive Bayes classification on user data.
- **Traffic** – Probabilistic localization in a noisy environment.

Each folder contains its own `README.md` with explanations, logic, and usage.

## 🎯 Focus Areas

- Search Algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*)
- Game Playing (Minimax, Q-learning)
- Knowledge Representation & Inference (Logic, CSPs)
- Probabilistic Models (Bayesian Updates, Naive Bayes)
- Machine Learning (Supervised & Reinforcement)
